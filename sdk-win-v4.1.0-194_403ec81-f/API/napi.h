 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * ## Async Operation
 *
 * NAPI is an asynchronous API that operates by sending stringified JSON objects to NAPI and receiving stringified JSON objects from NAPI.
 *
 * Making a request to NAPI (napi::put) is a non-blocking call returning immediately, and it always succeeds if NAPI has
 * been started (napi::PutOutcome). This success even after napi::terminate has been called is an historical detail
 * that will be addressed in a future release.
 *
 * Responses to requests are obtained by calling napi::get. Both responses to NEA requests and NAPI-generated
 * notifications are returned from this function. NAPI will include the `exchange` attribute when defined in the
 * request in all responses to the request. This is intended to allow the NEA to match responses to requests.
 *
 * Calls to napi::get are blocking -- they will wait for a result unless interrupted. Calls to napi::try_get return immediately.
 *
 * \note
 * -# napi::get succeeds even after napi::terminate has been called.
 * -# napi::get returns a mix of responses and NAPI generated notifications -- use the `exchange` attribute to identify responses to requests.
 *
 *
 * ## Basic NEA approaches to NAPI
 *
 * NAPI is an asynchronous API that works by an interchange of JSON strings between the NEA and NAPI. The details of the JSON are discussed <a href="../../json/html/index.html">here</a>.
 *
 * There are three common approaches to writing an NEA using NAPI:
 *
 * -# Intersperse calls to napi::put and napi::get.
 * -# Run napi::put and napi::get in their own threads, and link the response to the request using the `exchange`.
 * -# Run napi::put and napi::get in their own threads, and dispatch the responses by the `exchange`.
 *
 * The first approach is most useful in simple or short running NEAs. The second, and especially third, approaches are more useful in longer running or complex NEAs.
 *
 * ## Coordinating napi::get and napi::configure
 *
 * It is not possible for napi::get to succeed before napi::configure has completed successfully. During the startup phase napi::get will return
 * napi::GetOutcome::notRunning. If the NEA is trying to call both simultaneously, or nearly, then if the NEA receives a napi::GetOutcome::notRunning it is reasonable to
 * wait for a few milliseconds and try again. If the NEA is trying to call napi::get well before napi::configure you can use the same strategy, or choose some
 * other kind of coordination mechanism. Either way no JSON messages are dropped.
 *
 * \note
 * -# The time between the first successful call to napi::get and napi::configure does not matter, no messages are dropped.
 * -# napi::configure should only be called once.
 * -# Restarting NAPI is achieved by calling napi::terminate() followed by another call to napi::configure.
 * -# Errors that occur during NAPI startup may be reported as a general error notification. These are obtained by calling napi::get.
 *
 * ## Logs
 *
 * LogLevel::normal reports only warnings, errors, and fatal log messages. There is no sensitive information in these messages.
 * **However** if the LogLevel::info, LogLevel::debug, LogLevel::verbose levels are used then sensitive information almost certainly will be written
 * to the logs. This may be an acceptable risk when developing a NEA; it is **never** an acceptable risk when the NEA is deployed.
 *
 * The log files are crated in the config directory specified in napi::configure
 *
 * \warning
 * - Logs are written to the filesystem in **clear text**.
 * - All log levels, other than `LogLevel::normal`, write sensitive material, such as symmetric keys, to the log in **clear text**.
 * - Only `LogLevel::normal` should be used in a deployed NEA.
 * - Log files can become **very large** -- if used outside of a development and debugging context they **will** fill the disk.
